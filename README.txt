Sensor_Read.py is the main code that takes the data from the sensor and puts it into the database. The data is serialized and prepared for the JavaScript application that is in the html file. A local server is opened to host the files with the open_port bash script.

This code is for an IoT project. Connecting a Raspberry pi with a Co2 sensor, and building an interface for it. Used for testing Co2 levels in a given environment. And visualizing the data.
The entire system was built and coded from scratch. The device and output can be seen in the .jpg files. This is currently used in a professional environment.
