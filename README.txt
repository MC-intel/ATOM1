Sensor_Read.py is the main code that takes the data from the sensor and puts it into the database. The data is serialized and prepared for the JavaScript application that is in the html file. A local server is opned to host the files with the open_port bash script.

This code is for an IoT project. Connecting a Raspberry pi with a Co2 sensor, used for testing Co2 levels in an environment. And visualizing the data.
The entire system was built and coded from scratch. The end prodeuct can be seen in the .png files.
